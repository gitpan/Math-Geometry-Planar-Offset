BUGS
    There are currently some problems with concurrent edge events on outward
    (and maybe inward) offsets. Some significant changes need to be made.

METHODS
    These methods are actually defined in Math::Geometry::Planar, which uses
    this module.

  offset_polygon
    Returns reference to an array of polygons representing the original
    polygon offsetted by $distance

      $polygon->offset_polygon($distance);

Functions
    Only OffsetPolygon is exported.

  pi
    Returns the constant pi

  OffsetPolygon
    Make offset polygon subroutine.

    Call with offset distance and ref to array of points for original
    polygon polygon input must be pre-wrapped so point[n]=point[0]

    Will return a list of polygons (as refs)
